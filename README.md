Running the code as is in A3 main will first create a queue of intgers but the queue can be changed to any data type. Then it will fill the queue with intgers 1-10 and then will execute the frontE function that will show the first item in the queue then pop. It will do this 10 times. It will then add three more numbers to the queue and execute the frontE function to show the first item then move to rear function then frontE again to show the first item has changed. Then it will run the modified linear search and insertion sort to show that there is no problems with running them.
